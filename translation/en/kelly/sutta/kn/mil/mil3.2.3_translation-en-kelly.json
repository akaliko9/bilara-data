  "mil3.2.3:1.1": "The king asked: ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.2": "“Venerable Nāgasena, for one in whom knowledge has arisen, would wisdom also have arisen?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.3": "“Yes, your majesty, for one in whom knowledge has arisen, wisdom also has arisen.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.4": "“What, venerable sir, is knowledge the same as wisdom?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.5": "“Yes, your majesty, knowledge is the same as wisdom.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.6": "“Then, venerable sir, for one in whom knowledge has arisen which is the same as wisdom, would he be confused or would he not be confused?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.7": "“He would be confused in some instances, your majesty, and would not be confused in other instances.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.8": "“When, venerable sir, would he be confused?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.9": "“He would be confused, your majesty, concerning those aspects of a craft that he did not know before, or those directions in which he has not gone before, or those names and designations he has not heard before.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.10": "“When, venerable sir, would he not be confused?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.11": "“He would not be confused, your majesty, concerning that which he has discerned by wisdom, that is, the notions of impermanent, suffering, and not self.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.12": "“Then where, venerable sir, does his confusion go?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:1.13": "“Confusion ceases, your majesty, at that very moment when knowledge arises.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:2.1": "“Please give me an analogy.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:2.2": "“Just as, your majesty, some person might bring in a lamp to a dark house, then the darkness ceases, and light appears. ",
  "mil3.2.3:2.3": "In the same way, your majesty, at the moment when knowledge arises, right there confusion ceases.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:3.1": "“Then where, venerable sir, does wisdom go?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:3.2": "“Wisdom, your majesty, ceases right there having done its task, but that understood by wisdom, the notion of impermanent, suffering, and not self does not cease.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:4.1": "“Venerable Nāgasena, what you have just said, ‘Wisdom ceases right there having done its task, but that understood by wisdom, the notion of impermanent, suffering, and not self does not cease,’ please make an analogy for that.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:4.2": "“Just as, your majesty, some person, wishing to send a letter at night, would summon a scribe and light a lamp, and have the letter written. Then, when the letter is written, he would extinguish the lamp. And when the lamp is extinguished the letter would not be destroyed.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:4.3": "In the same way, your majesty, wisdom ceases right there having done its task, but that understood by wisdom, the notion of impermanent, suffering, and not self does not cease.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:5.1": "“Give me another analogy.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:5.2": "“Just as, your majesty, people in the eastern districts might set up five water pots in each house so as to extinguish any burning, and when a house is on fire, they would throw these five pots of water on top of the house, then the fire would be extinguished. Would it occur to these people, your majesty, ‘We must make use of these pots again’?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:5.3": "“Certainly not, venerable sir, those pots have done their job, what further need would there be for them?” ",
  "mil3.2.3:5.4": "“As, your majesty, are the five pots of water, so the five faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom are to be seen. ",
  "mil3.2.3:5.5": "As those people, so the spiritual practitioner is to be seen. ",
  "mil3.2.3:5.6": "As the fire, so the defilements are to be seen. ",
  "mil3.2.3:5.7": "As the fire is extinguished by the five pots of water, so the defilements are extinguished by the five faculties, and those extinguished defilements do not arise again. ",
  "mil3.2.3:5.8": "In the same way, your majesty, wisdom ceases right there having done its task, but that understood by wisdom, the notion of impermanent, suffering, and not self does not cease.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:6.1": "“Give me another analogy.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:6.8": "In the same way, your majesty, wisdom ceases right there having done its task, but that understood by wisdom, the notion of impermanent, suffering, and not self does not cease.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:7.1": "“Give me another analogy.” ",
  "mil3.2.3:7.8": "In the same way, your majesty, wisdom ceases right there having done its task, but that understood by wisdom, the notion of impermanent, suffering, and not self does not cease.” ",
