  "mil3.2.6:1.2": "“Venerable Nāgasena, what reconnects?” ",
  "mil3.2.6:1.3": "The elder said: ",
  "mil3.2.6:1.4": "“Name-and-form, your majesty, reconnects.” ",
  "mil3.2.6:1.5": "“Does this very name-and-form reconnect?” ",
  "mil3.2.6:1.6": "“This very name-and-form, your majesty, does not reconnect. With this name-and-form one performs a lovely or an evil action, and by this action another name-and-form reconnects.” ",
  "mil3.2.6:1.7": "“If, venerable sir, this very name-and-form does not reconnect, is it not then that one would be freed from evil actions?” ",
  "mil3.2.6:1.8": "The elder said: ",
  "mil3.2.6:1.9": "“If it would not reconnect, then it would be freed from evil actions. ",
  "mil3.2.6:1.10": "But because, your majesty, it does reconnect, it therefore is not freed from evil actions.” ",

Those mangos I took are not the same as those that this person planted; I do not deserve punishment.’ ",
  "mil3.2.6:2.3": "Would that man, your majesty, deserve punishment?” ",
  "mil3.2.6:2.4": "“Yes, venerable sir, he would deserve punishment.” ",
  "mil3.2.6:2.5": "“For what reason?” ",
  "mil3.2.6:2.6": "“Whatever he might say, venerable sir, while not disavowing the earlier mangos, he would be deserving of punishment due to the later mangos.” ",
  "mil3.2.6:2.7": "“In the same way, your majesty, with this name-and-form one performs a lovely or an evil action, and by this action another name-and-form reconnects. Therefore, one is not freed from evil actions.” ",
  "mil3.2.6:3.1": "“Give me another analogy.” ",

  "mil3.2.6:3.4": "Just as, your majesty, some person or other might light a fire during the wintertime, and warm himself, and might leave without having extinguished it, and that fire might burn another person’s field. And the owner of the field might grab that person and point him out to the king, saying ‘My field has been burned by this man.’ ",
  "mil3.2.6:3.5": "And he might say ‘Lord, I did not set fire to this person’s field. The fire I did not extinguish was not the same as the fire that burned this person’s field; I do not deserve punishment.’ ",
