  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc96:2.2.2": "[Sp.4.1227](): _Acchinnacīvarikāyātiādīsu saṅkaccikacīvarameva cīvaranti veditabbaṃ_, “Her robe is stolen, etc.: just the robe which is the chest cover is to be understood.” The “etc”, _ādisu_, refers to the following non-offense, “If her robe is lost”. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc96:2.2.11": "Following this, the Pali reads _Dhammikavagga_ to indicate the last chapter of _pācittiya_ rules for the nuns, and then _Nandasikkhāpada_ to indicate the last rule in the chapter of _pācittiya_ rules. These indications are redundant in the present translation, since I have pointed out all the missing rules, including direct references to their counterparts in the chapter on _pācittiya_ rules for the _bhikkhus_.
