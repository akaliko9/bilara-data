In this way they omit the announcement.” The commentary then goes on to say that even omitting syllables or mispronunciation counts as _hāpeti_. This, however, goes further than the rules for legal procedures laid down in the Chapter connected with Campā at [Kd 9:3.3.3](pli-tv-kd9:3.3.3)--3.4.9. | [Sp.5.485](): _Akāle vā sāvetīti sāvanāya akāle anokāse ñattiṃ aṭṭhapetvā paṭhamaṃyeva anussāvanakammaṃ katvā pacchā ñattiṃ ṭhapeti_, “‘Or the announcement is made at the wrong time’: it is the wrong time, the wrong occasion, for the announcement. Without putting forward the motion, they first make the announcement and then put forward the motion.” ",

The meaning is that one should not not do any kind of legal procedure.” The last line means one should or must take part in the legal procedure. ",
  "pli-tv-pvr21:7.2": "The one who is subject to the legal procedure cannot take part in the legal procedure in the sense of being part of the decision making. However, he needs to be present _at_ the legal procedure when the decision is made. ",

I ask the Sangha for forgiveness.’ Having asked three times, he is to be readmitted through a legal procedure consisting of getting permission.” “Shaving” refers to the Sangha giving permission to shave someone’s head prior to ordination, see [Kd 1:48.2.7](pli-tv-kd1:48.2.7). For the “supreme penalty”, see [Kd 21:1.12.1](pli-tv-kd21:1.12.1)--1.12.9.

They told the Buddha. “Monks, you shouldn’t splash the nuns with muddy water. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow the nuns to penalize a monk who acts like this.” The monks thought, “What sort of penalty should they impose?” They told the Buddha. “The Sangha of nuns shouldn’t pay respect to such a monk.”’ This is the fifth situation of this legal procedure consisting of getting permission, that is, a legal procedure with similar characteristics. It is called a legal procedure with similar characteristics because it has the characteristics of that legal procedure, but it is not admittance, etc.” ",
