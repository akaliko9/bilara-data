  "an11.17:1.3": "“Knowing form” (_rūpaññū _) means being able to keep track of the herd by reckoning or recognizing them. | “Ford” is _tittha_, i.e. a way to get across. | “Smoke out pests” is _dhūmaṁ kattā_, referring to the traditional practice of warding off flies and other  pests by burning cow dung, etc. | “Satisfy” is _pīta_, which is less literal than “drink”, but clarifies the simile later on.
