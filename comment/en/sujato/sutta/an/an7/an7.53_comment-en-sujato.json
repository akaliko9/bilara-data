  "an7.53:6.10": "_Puññamahī_ (“flourishing of merit”), for which there are several variants in text and commentary, is found only here and at [mn35:30.5](), where it also concerns the dedication of merit to another. It might refer to the glorious results of merit, for which compare Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.2, “endowed with that [divine fruit for which he wished] he flourishes (_tena sampanno mahīyate_). Or else it might invoke the idea that merit flourishes depending on the recipient, like a seed on the earth (_mahī_; cp. _puññakkhetta_). "
