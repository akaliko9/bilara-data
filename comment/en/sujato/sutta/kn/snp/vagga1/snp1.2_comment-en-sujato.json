  "snp1.2:1.1": "This verse evidently refers to his completion of a household rite involving offering of cooked food (_pākayajña_). These household (Sanskrit _gṛhya_) rites are mostly attested in later treatises, so this is one of the places that show they were known earlier.. ",
  "snp1.2:1.4": "“My fire kindled” (_āhito gini_, cf. Sanskrit _āhitāgni_) refers to one who has set up his fire altar. ",
  "snp1.2:2.1": "The Buddha puns _pakkodano_ (“boiled rice”) with _akkodhano_ (“without anger”). ",
  "snp1.2:2.4": "The Buddha directly counters the kindled Vedic fire with Nibbana as the quenching of the flame. ",
  "snp1.2:4.2": "Norman points out that this verse is not a proper response to the previous and suggests that a verse has been lost. I agree, but I disagree there is a contradiction in the sense. Rather, the verse tells a story over time. I translate to bring out the meaning. ",
  "snp1.2:7.3": "I’m not convinced by the commentary’s “not separated”. It doesn’t seem to occur in this meaning elsewhere, and lacks a connection with the opening line. Surely the whole verse must be about the children, which requires that there be a comparison made with the first line. The point is, I think, that the children follow the father and have become self-sufficient. This also echoes better with the Buddha’s response. ",
  "snp1.2:15.2": "Norman and Bodhi read the middle form _carāmase_ as imperative, apparently, but that doesn’t make sense to me; in this context optative would make more sense, but I am not aware of this form. Rather, I take it as the present indicative in the sense of definite future. "
