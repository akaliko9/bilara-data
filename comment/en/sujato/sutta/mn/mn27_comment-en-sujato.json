  "mn27:2.1": "We meet Jānussoṇi many times in the suttas, where he converses with the Buddha on a number of topics, with a special interest in the afterlife. His name appears in Sanskrit as Jānaśruti or Jānaśruteya, which are patronymics of Janaśruti, “famed among the people”, with the element _soṇi_ coming from the Vedic _ṣvaṇi_ (“sound”). The Chinese rendering <span lang='lzh'>生聞</span> (“Born Famous”, T 125.2.665b18) evidently assumes the same derivation (_jana_ “people” is from √_jan_ “born”). The Pali commentary says it is a title awarded the family priest (_purohita_) of Kosala, which would make him one of the most powerful brahmins alive. However, I can find no confirmation of such a title, whereas the use of Jānaśruti as a patronymic by the descendants of Janaśruti is well attested. ",
  "mn27:2.2": "Pilotika Vacchāyana is not mentioned elsewhere. His first name means “patch” and may be a reference to his patchwork robe (cp. “Ajita of the hair-blanket”). Vacchāyana is a patronymic, possibly indicating he was of the lineage of Vātsya, a student of Yājñavalkya (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.5.1.62, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 2.35.29). ",
  "mn27:4.4": "While the dict, followed by translators, treats osarati in a neutral sense here “visit”, the contexts don’t bear this out. It is used in a literal sense of “come down” (from the wilderness, specially the Himalayas) (AN 6.42), with a side-order of “fall so low as to …” or even “descend upon” (like the plague). ",

  "mn27:10.18": "BB, Ṭhānissaro, and Horner all take “kaneruka “as” having tusks”, but this seems unjustified. If the PTS dict (following comm.) is right in saying kaneru is a “young elephant”, we can take “kaneruka” as a possessive, i.e. “she-elephant with calves”, i.e. “mature, fully-grown”, which is, in any case, implied by the context.
