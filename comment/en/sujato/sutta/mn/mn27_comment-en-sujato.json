  "mn27:2.2": "Pilotika Vacchāyana is not mentioned elsewhere. His first name means “patch” and may be a reference to his patchwork robe (cp. “Ajita of the hair-blanket”). Vacchāyana is a patronymic, possibly indicating he was of the lineage of Vātsya, a student of Yājñavalkya (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.5.1.62, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 2.35.29). ",
  "mn27:2.7": "As at [mn99:30.7]() and [an5.194:2.4](). The Buddha speaks of his own lucidity of wisdom at [mn12:62.6](). ",

  "mn27:10.6": "This passage names three kinds of cow elephants unknown elsewhere. From the context they must be of ascending height. The first is the “dwarf” (_vāmanikā_). ",
  "mn27:10.12": "_Kāḷārikā_ is related to Sanskrit _karāla_, which may mean “lofty” or “with  gaping teeth”. The commentary applies the latter meaning, but surely the former fits the context. ",
  "mn27:10.18": "One of the many Indic names for elephants, especially cows, is _kareṇu_ (_kaṇeru_ by metathesis), which has the same meaning as the more common _hatthi_, “handy”. I think the _kaṇerukā_ is the “leader of the cows”, i.e. the matriarch of the herd. ",

  "mn27:13.3": "“Chastity” is _brahmacariya_, literally “divine conduct”. Here it is used in the narrow sense of refraining from sex, but more commonly it has a broader sense of “spiritual life”.  Buddhist monastics are forbidden from any form of sexual activity. To engage in penetrative intercourse is an expulsion offence. ",
  "mn27:13.4": "This is the first of the four kinds of right speech. Just as the precept of not killing implies the positive injunction to live with compassion, the precepts on speech enjoin a positive and constructive use of speech. If a monastic falsely claims states of enlightenment or deep meditation they are expelled. ",
  "mn27:13.5": "“Harmony” (or “unanimity”, _samagga_) does not excuse untrue, bigoted, or otherwise harmful speech. True harmony is only achieved in the presence of the Dhamma. ",
  "mn27:13.7": "_Attha_ is a polyvalent term, here taking the senses  “meaningful” and “beneficial”. Elsewhere it means “goal”, “need”, “purpose”, “lawsuit”, or “ending”, and the senses are not always easy to untangle. ",

  "mn27:13.12": "To avoid sleeping too much. ",
  "mn27:13.13": "Literally “gold and silver” (_jātarūparajata_), but _rajata_ is explained in [Bu NP 18](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np18/en/brahmali#2.8) as currency of any kind. ",
