  "mn27:2.2": "Pilotika Vacchāyana is not mentioned elsewhere. His first name means “patch” and may be a reference to his patchwork robe (cp. “Ajita of the hair-blanket”). Vacchāyana is a patronymic, possibly indicating he was of the lineage of Vātsya, a student of Yājñavalkya (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.5.1.62, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 2.35.29). ",

  "mn27:13.1": "The first and most important precept. It is not just the negative injunction to avoid killing, but also the positive injunction to have compassion for all creatures. If a monastic murders a human being they are immediately and permanently expelled. ",

  "mn27:13.3": "“Chastity” is _brahmacariya_, literally “divine conduct”. Here it is used in the narrow sense of refraining from sex, but more commonly it has a broader sense of “spiritual life”.
