  "mn27:2.1": "A chariot drawn by mares was the preferred vehicle of Jānussoṇi ([mn99:30.1](), [sn45.4:1.3]()), as well as the brahmin student Ambaṭṭha [dn3:1.6.1](). ",
  "mn27:2.2": "Pilotika Vacchāyana is not mentioned elsewhere. His first name means “patch” and may be a reference to his patchwork robe (cp. “Ajita of the hair-blanket”). Vacchāyana is a patronymic, possibly indicating he was of the lineage of Vātsya, a student of Yājñavalkya (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.5.1.62, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 2.35.29). ",
