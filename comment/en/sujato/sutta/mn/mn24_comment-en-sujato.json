  "mn24:2.1": "The commentary says _jātibhūmi_ means the Buddha’s native land, but the word occurs at [an6.54](), [pli-tv-pvr14:2.1](), [ja537:26.1](), and [ja546:43.1](), where it always means “one’s native land”. Given that Puṇṇa, the most famous teacher of their land, was unknown by Sāriputta, it seems likely that it was somewhat remote. One of the Chinese parallels (MA 9) describes him as of light skin and prominent nose, a description befitting someone from the north-west of India. ",
  "mn24:2.4": "Although said to be the foremost Dhamma speaker ([an1.196:1.1](), see [sn14.15:2.14]()), few of his teachings are recorded. At [sn22.83](), Ānanda attributes his initial breakthrough to Puṇṇa, while a single verse is attributed to him at [thag1.4](). | Puṇṇa was evidently from the same maternal clan as Aṅgulimāla ([mn86:12.12]()). This name does not seem to occur in Sanskritic texts, but Mahāvastu 3.377 spells it as Maitrāyaṇī, a name shared with the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā, the oldest ritual text of the Black Yajurveda. ",

  "mn24:7.1": "Sāriputta’s urgency here reinforces the impression that Puṇṇa lived somewhere distant and visited the central regions only occasionally. ",
  "mn24:8.2": "The following seven “purifications” became one of the primary textual sources for the “insight knowledges” (_vipassanañāṇa_) that became central to later Theravada meditation. Phrased slightly differently, the purifications of ethics, mind, view, and freedom are found at [an4.194](), while all seven, plus wisdom and freedom, are at [dn34:2.2.6](). Both these suttas are to be dated after the death of the Buddha. The current sutta also, with its variety of unusual features, seems somewhat late. ",
  "mn24:9.1": "Puṇṇa was a stranger, so Sāriputta begins by establishing common ground before asking a series of questions to which he expects a negative answer. ",
  "mn24:9.3": "The questions are framed in an unusual paired syntax: _kiṁ nu kho, āvuso_ alternates with _kiṁ panāvuso_. ",
  "mn24:9.5": "“Purification of mind” is the development of absorption to abandon the hindrances ([an4.194:4.1]()). ",
  "mn24:9.7": "“Purified view” is the right view of the stream-enterer who has seen the four noble truths. Likewise, the items from here down to “practice” all refer to stream-entry. ",
  "mn24:9.9": "Doubt is one of the fetters overcome by the stream-enterer. ",
  "mn24:9.11": "From their own experience, a stream-enterer knows what leads to the goal and what does not. | For _maggāmagga_, see the discussion with brahmin students at [dn13:3.1](). ",
  "mn24:9.13": "A stream-enterer understands that they have fulfilled all eight factors of the noble eightfold path. ",

  "mn24:14.4": "Explained by the commentary here as “seven chariots with horses at the ready”, where _vinīta_ has its usual sense of “trained, readied”. While the series of chariots forms a relay, the word _vinīta_ does not mean “relay”. ",
