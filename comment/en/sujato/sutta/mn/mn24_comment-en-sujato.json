  "mn24:2.1": "The commentary says _jātibhūmi_ means the Buddha’s native land, but the word occurs at [an6.54](), [pli-tv-pvr14:2.1](), [ja537:26.1](), and [ja546:43.1](), where it always means “one’s native land”. Given that Puṇṇa, the most famous teacher of their land, was unknown by Sāriputta, it seems likely that it was somewhat remote. ",
  "mn24:2.4": "Although said to be the foremost Dhamma speaker ([an1.196:1.1](), see [sn14.15:2.14]()), few of his teachings are recorded. At [sn22.83](), Ānanda attributes his initial breakthrough to Puṇṇa, while a single verse is attributed to him at [thag1.4](). | Puṇṇa was evidently from the same maternal clan as Aṅgulimāla ([mn86:12.12]()). This name does not seem to occur in Sanskritic texts, but Mahāvastu 3.377 spells it as Maitrāyaṇī, a name shared with the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā, the oldest ritual text of the Black Yajurveda. ",

  "mn24:7.1": "Sāriputta’s urgency here reinforces the impression that Puṇṇa lived somewhere distant and visited the central regions only occasionally. ",
  "mn24:8.2": "This series of questions was one of the primary textual sources for the “insight knowledges” (_vipassanañāṇa_) that became central to later Theravada meditation. ",
  "mn24:9.1": "Puṇṇa was a stranger, so Sāriputta begins by establishing common ground before asking a series of questions to which he expects a negative answer. ",
  "mn24:9.3": "The questions are framed in an unusual paired syntax: _kiṁ nu kho, āvuso_ alternates with _kiṁ panāvuso_. ",

  "mn24:9.9": "Cf vitareyya ogham, the basic metaphor is to move over or across, not to defeat. ",
  "mn24:11.15": "BB has “to be attained without these states”, but this seems to be unwarranted. I am not sure if this is just an amplification, or whether it reads the -ehi as causal. However aññatra usually takes the ablative and that is the case here. Ṭhānissaro gets this right. ",
