  "mn40:1.1": "This sutta deals with a similar topic to the previous, with differences in phrasing and content. ",
  "mn40:4.1": "“Deadborn” (_mataja_) is explained by the commentary as forged from iron filings recovered from the corpse of a dead heron, which was force-fed them for that purpose. | _Pītanisita_ may mean “sharpened with a wet (_pīta_) stone” per the commentary, or else “sharpened with yellow arsenic” (_pīta_). Arthaśāstra 2.14.48 describes how metals may be rubbed with yellow arsenic (here = _haritāla_) to disguise them. This fits the context, where a supposed monk wrapped in the ocher robe is like the metal, outwardly shiny yellow, but inside is deadly. ",
  "mn40:5.3": "Wearers of dust and dirt are mentioned at [dn8:14.18]() and [dn25:8.16.](), along with several other items on this list; see too [dhp141]() and [thag4.5:1.2](), and the description of the Bodhisatta at [mn12:46.5](). Some ascetics, such as Jains, did not bathe. ",
  "mn40:5.9": "BB’s incantations is a little harsh here. Manta in the suttas usually refers, not to magic, but to the Vedas. ",
  "mn40:13.3": "Translating parḷāaha as fever here is incorrect. While in ancient Indian medicine it was obviously the same, in modern terms there is a distinction between physiological rise in body temperature due to fever, and illnesses induced by excessive heat. Since the condition here may be severe, but is alleviated by rest and cool water, it corresponds with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion "
