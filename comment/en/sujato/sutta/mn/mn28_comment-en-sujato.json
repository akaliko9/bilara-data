  "mn28:1.3": "This sutta is a masterclass on the methods employed by the Buddha’s greatest student, Sāriputta. He begins with a solid grounding on the four noble truths, then proceeds to unpack them systematically, leading to a lengthy analysis of the four elements. But the unpacking takes unexpected and often quite moving directions, as Sāriputta draws on unexpected layers of the Dhamma to illustrate a familiar teaching in new ways. ",
  "mn28:2.2": "Sāriputta’s emphasis on the four noble truths is also shown in [mn9]() and [mn141](). ",
  "mn28:5.1": "Delving into the four noble truths leads us to the actual topic, the four elements. But in this topic we will find not just matter, but connections that lead us back to the four noble truths. ",
  "mn28:6.2": "That is to say, inside oneself or in the world outside oneself. ",
  "mn28:6.4": "“Appropriated” (_upādinna_) is a technical term referring to matter that has been “taken up” or “grasped” at birth, namely the organic body. ",
  "mn28:6.7": "The exterior element is not defined here. Rather, the sutta moves by collapsing the distinction between interior and exterior. ",
  "mn28:6.8": "Since what is “in here” and what is “out there” are the same element, how can it be “my” body? ",
  "mn28:7.3": "Read _mahallikā_ as “old” rather than “large”. ",
  "mn28:7.4": "The key to this difficult sentence is recognizing that _atha kho_ here is adversative (compare [dn23:8.1](): “Even though Master Kassapa says this, nonetheless I think that”, _kiñcāpi bhavaṁ kassapo evamāha, atha kho evaṁ me ettha hoti_). | _Notevettha hoti_ resolves as follows: _no [ti]_ (the negative is distributed across the three terms, I, mine, I am); _ev[a]_ conveys exclusivity; _ettha_ with _hoti_ and the genitive means “think about that” (eg. [mn38:18.4]()). ",
  "mn28:8.1": "The motif of mendicants being attacked is found occasionally in the suttas, but more commonly in texts of the Jains, who went naked and did not bathe. ",
  "mn28:8.2": "Sāriputta brings in a reflection on conditionality, not as a philosophy, but as a skillful method of defusing reactive emotions. ",
  "mn28:8.6": "With the previously-mentioned form, now all five aggregates are included. ",
  "mn28:8.7": "NOTE: Nyanamoli/BB’s “objective basis” is an unwarranted intrusion of abhidhamma ideas. This set of verbs always occur together and there is no need to treat them any other way here. arammana in the EBTs typically means something close to “meditation subject”. It’s used in the sense of the contemplative practice, relying on which, the desired outcome is achieved. ",
  "mn28:9.5": "Sāriputta is quoting from [mn21:21.1](). ",
  "mn28:12.1": "NOTE: Older translations take this in the sense “gets angry”, while BB and Ṭhānissaro have “disturbed, agitated”. the former is unjustified as the elements are not personalized, while the latter is too weak. The term is only used, here and AN 5.197, in the sense of a sudden destructive expansion or inflation; note that the term is not used for the next passage, where there is a diminution. "
