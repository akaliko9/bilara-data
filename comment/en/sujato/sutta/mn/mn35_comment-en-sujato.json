  "mn35:2.1": "Saccaka is called _nigaṇṭhaputta_, being the only person so described. The _nigaṇṭhas_ (“knotless ones”) were Jain ascetics and their followers were _nigaṇṭhasāvaka_ ([sn42.9:2.3]()). The commentary says he was the son of Jain parents. From the ending of this sutta we can see he was not an ascetic, and from [mn36:48.11]() it is clear he was not a Jain. ",
  "mn35:3.1": "Assaji was one the group of five mendicants who received the Buddha’s first discourse ([pli-tv-kd1:6.36.1]()). Shortly afterwards he inspired Sāriputta ([pli-tv-kd1:23.2.1]()). Note that Sāriputta waited politely until almsround was complete before approaching, whereas Saccaka just goes right ahead. We hear of a grave illness Assaji suffered later ([sn22.88]()). | Another Assaji, who is always paired with his friend Punabbasuka, was a lazy and indulgent monk ([mn70:4.1]()). ",
  "mn35:4.1": "The idiom _sāvake vineti_ (“guide his disciples”) is typically used by non-Buddhists. | The phrase _kathaṁbhāgā_ (and its counterpart _evaṁbhāgā_ in the next line) are unique. The literal sense is “with what portion”, and given the answer I think Saccaka is asking for a list of topics. ",
  "mn35:4.3": "As usual, the five aggregates are mentioned as if expecting the listener to know them. ",
  "mn35:4.6": "Despite this, this manner of teaching, which omits mention of suffering, is unusual and only appears when teaching non-Buddhists. ",
  "mn35:5.6": "BB has “tank”, but udakarahada is always, so far as I can see, always used in the sense of “lake”. I don’t see any reason why such a sieve would not have been rinsed in a lake. ",
  "mn35:5.8": "cp AN 6.53 and SN 22.102 ",
  "mn35:5.10": "Accepting the amendation proposed by PTS dict, sandhovika, cp AN 10.99 ",
  "mn35:11.6": "nibbetheti = to unravel, disentangle, clarify. BB’s “confine yourself”, by coincidence or not, is the same as Chalmers. ",
  "mn35:12.4": "Rather curiously, all the translations of this I have seen render the future passive participle here as “deserves “or” should”, but no-one notes that this reading, if correct, shows the Buddha endorsed capital punishment. I don’t believe he did, and it is over-interpreting the passage to read it that way. Rather, the fpp should be read in its weaker sense of “to be …”, i.e. he has the power to execute those who have been condemned to death, or who have committed crimes punishable by death. It does not imply a moral endorsement of this power. Such is, in fact, supplied by Aggivessana, who explicitly endorses capital punishment (despite his Jain non-violence!) ",
  "mn35:16.2": "Here neither attention nor focus suits manasikara. The Buddha is telling Saccaka to recollect an earlier statement when making a later one, i.e. to practice basic rationality. ",
  "mn35:24.4": "The point of this passage is for Saccaka to, semi-sincerely, wriggle out of his initial statement. Translating the person as plural is misleading, as it can easily be read as referring to “our” (the Buddha and Saccaka’s), whereas it really refers to Saccaka’s initial claim; Saccaka has been using plural for himself. Next, consider this phrase. Vilapa is used in the suttas not quite in the sense of “prattle”, which is a babble or torrent of meaningless speech, but rather simply an empty or hollow claim. What he’s doing here is the same as modern trolls who claim their idea are meant “ironically”. ",
