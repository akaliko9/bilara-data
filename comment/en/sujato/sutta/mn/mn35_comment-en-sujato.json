  "mn35:2.1": "Saccaka is called _nigaṇṭhaputta_, being the only person so described. The _nigaṇṭhas_ (“knotless ones”) were Jain ascetics and their followers were _nigaṇṭhasāvaka_ ([sn42.9:2.3]()). The commentary says he was the son of Jain parents. From the ending of this sutta we can see he was not an ascetic, and from [mn36:48.11]() it is clear he was not a Jain. ",
  "mn35:3.1": "Assaji was one the group of five mendicants who received the Buddha’s first discourse ([pli-tv-kd1:6.36.1]()). Shortly afterwards he inspired Sāriputta ([pli-tv-kd1:23.2.1]()). Note that Sāriputta waited politely until almsround was complete before approaching, whereas Saccaka just goes right ahead. We hear of a grave illness Assaji suffered later ([sn22.88]()). | Another Assaji, who is always paired with his friend Punabbasuka, was a lazy and indulgent monk ([mn70:4.1]()). ",
  "mn35:4.1": "_Sāvake vineti_ (“guide his disciples”) is typically used by non-Buddhists. | The phrase _kathaṁbhāgā_ (and its counterpart _evaṁbhāgā_ in the next line) are unique. The literal sense is “with what portion”, and given the answer I think Saccaka is asking for a list of topics. ",
  "mn35:4.2": "Saccaka is addressed with the Bramanical clan name Aggivessana, probably after the lineage of his clan’s _purohita_, just as the Sakyans are called Gotama and the Mallas Vāseṭṭha. ",
  "mn35:4.3": "The five aggregates are mentioned as if the listener is expected to know them. ",
  "mn35:4.5": "",
  "mn35:4.6": "Despite this, this manner of teaching, which omits mention of “suffering” (_dukkha_), is unusual and only appears when teaching non-Buddhists. ",
  "mn35:5.6": "BB has “tank”, but udakarahada is always, so far as I can see, always used in the sense of “lake”. I don’t see any reason why such a sieve would not have been rinsed in a lake. ",
  "mn35:5.8": "See [an6.53]() and [sn22.102](). ",
  "mn35:5.10": "Emend _sāṇadhovikaṁ_ (“hemp-washing”) to _kaṇṇadhovikaṁ_ (“ear-washing”) after [an10.99:3.4](). ",
  "mn35:10.7": " Saccaka treats the five aggregates as categories for classifying the self. And indeed elsewhere, such as [dn1](), we find various theorists describe the self as “form”, experiencing “feelings”, being “percipient”, etc. In identifying each of the five aggregates as self, Saccaka follows the method of “affirmation” whereby multiple phenomena are affirmed to be the self at deeper and deeper levels, in contrast with the method of “negation” where potential candidates for the self are denied until the final self is revealed. These contrasting approaches feature in dialogues such as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1. ",
  "mn35:11.6": "",
  "mn35:12.4": "The Pali uses the future passive participle, sometimes interpreted as “deserving of execution”. But this would imply that the Buddha endorsed capital punishment, which is unsupported elsewhere and contradicts his ethical principles. Rather, read in its weaker literal sense, “execute those to be executed”, i.e. those who have been found guilty of a crime incurring capital punishment. It is an acknowledgment of the king’s powers, not an endorsement of them. ",
  "mn35:12.12": "Overstepping the Buddha’s position, Saccaka’s endorsement of capital punishment shows how far he has drifted from the non-violent doctrine of his Jain parents. ",
  "mn35:16.2": "Here neither attention nor focus suits manasikara. The Buddha is telling Saccaka to recollect an earlier statement when making a later one, i.e. to practice basic rationality. ",
  "mn35:24.4": "The point of this passage is for Saccaka to, semi-sincerely, wriggle out of his initial statement. Translating the person as plural is misleading, as it can easily be read as referring to “our” (the Buddha and Saccaka’s), whereas it really refers to Saccaka’s initial claim; Saccaka has been using plural for himself. Next, consider this phrase. Vilapa is used in the suttas not quite in the sense of “prattle”, which is a babble or torrent of meaningless speech, but rather simply an empty or hollow claim. What he’s doing here is the same as modern trolls who claim their idea are meant “ironically”. ",
