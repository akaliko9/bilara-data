  "mn39:1.2": "Assapura, the “horse fort”, appears to be unknown apart from its mention here and the next sutta. Contra *Dictionary of Pali Proper Names*, this is not the same Assapura referred to in [ja422](), as that lay south of Ceti, far to the west. An Aśvapura is mentioned in Jain legends, but there is nothing to link this with the Aṅgan town. | Aṅga lay to the east of Magadha on the Ganges, towards modern Bengal. ",

  "mn39:2.2": "This sutta deals with the difference between outer perception and inner reality, addressing what we call “imposter syndrome”. The Buddha inspires students to aspire to the highest ideal through the practice of the Gradual Training so that they live up to their labels and claims. ",
  "mn39:4.2": "_Chiddavā_ (“inconsistent”) is more literally “full of holes”. Its opposite (_acchidda_) is one of the standard descriptors of “impeccable” precepts (eg. [mn48:6.12]()). | _Saṁvuta_ (past participle of _saṁvara_) can mean either “restrained” or “hidden, secretive”. The sense depends on the syntax; the two instances of _ca_ split the listed items into three plus two, with the negative distributed over the last two items. This agrees with the commentary, which explains “secretive” as “concealing one’s faults”. _Saṁvara_ appears in the sense of sense restraint below ([mn39:8.4]()). ",
