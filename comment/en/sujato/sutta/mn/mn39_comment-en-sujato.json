  "mn39:1.2": "Assapura, the “horse fort”, appears to be unknown apart from its mention here and the next sutta. Contra *Dictionary of Pali Proper Names*, this is not the same Assapura referred to in [ja422](), as that lay south of Ceti, far to the west. An Aśvapura is mentioned in Jain legends, but there is nothing to link this with the Aṅgan town. | Aṅga lay to the east of Magadha on the Ganges, towards modern Bengal. ",

  "mn39:4.2": "While samvuta usually means “restrained”, here I think it means “hidden, covered up”. The sentence construction is ambiguous and unusual, with the introduction of ca for the last two terms, but na applied to only one of them. But I think na is meant to be distributed. This accords with Comm, which defines chidda as “consistent” and saṁvutoti as “closing a door over the defilements, not concealing one’s faults, is the meaning” kilesānaṁ dvāra pidahanena pidahito, na vajjapaṭicchādanatthāya.'This makes better sense as samvara is brought up in the next section. Chalmers is the only translator who catches this sense. ",

  "mn39:20.3": "BB has “houses” but it is singular; Horner gets this right. Ṭhānissaro, in what looks like a copy paste error, has the wrong simile here. "
