  "mn26:1.1": "This discourse is known in Pali manuscripts and commentaries either as “The Noble Quest” or “The Pile of Snares”, whereas the Chinese parallel at MA 204 is titled “The Discourse at Rāma’s Hermitage”. It is one of several discourses in the Majjhima that include a partial account of Siddhattha’s practice before awakening, an account that became one of the key events in the Buddha’s biography. ",
  "mn26:2.3": "This is expressed twice elsewhere in the Pali, but both times there is a clear narrative reason. At [an7.52:1.3]() the Buddha was making one of his rare visits to the relatively remote city of Campā, while at [sn22.81:3.5]() the Buddha had left the squabbling Sangha for the seclusion of the forest. The text gives us no indication as to why, in the central teaching location of Sāvatthī, the Buddha has not been teaching. The following sequence is quite unusual, and I suspect some narrative context has been lost. ",
  "mn26:2.5": "Rammaka appears only here, and the lack of any context for him might be another indication of narrative loss. The commentary offers no information on him. Might he be a follower of Rāma, Uddaka’s teacher? ",
  "mn26:3.1": "The narrative sequence from the Buddha returning from alms round to coming out from his bath is also found at [an6.43:1.3](). ",
  "mn26:4.2": "Here (and at [mn92:4.1]()) a “hermitage” (_assama_, “ashram”) is a sizable building suitable for gatherings, whereas at [sn11.9:1.4]() it is a gated compound with leaf huts. ",
  "mn26:4.4": "As at [an9.4:1.4](). ",
  "mn26:5.1": "The Buddha picks up from the fact that the mendicants were talking about him, but continues in a depersonalized manner. | The substance of this passage is taught more briefly at [an4.255](). ",
  "mn26:5.2": "These opposing searches respond to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.22, which we have already noted as the probable source for the phrase _so attā so loko_ ([mn22:15.10]()). It says that the wise ones of old, renouncing the search for sons, for wealth, and for the heavenly worlds, lived the mendicant’s life (_putraiṣaṇāyāśca vittaiṣaṇāyāśca lokaiṣaṇāyāśca vyutthāyātha bhikśācaryaṃ caranti_). The inner self sought by the brahmins is described as unborn, made of consciousness, undecaying, unattached, and unaffected by karma; knowing it one becomes a sage. ",
  "mn26:6.1": "The Pali includes “gold and money” among those things subject to birth, old age, and defilement. The Chinese parallel MA 204 (T i 776a7; cf. T 765 at T xvii 679b23) does not mention “birth” but says money and jewelry are subject to old age, defilement, etc. Elsewhere in the suttas, rebirth, old age, and defilement are qualities of sentient beings, not inanimate objects, so this might be a textual corruption. Nonetheless, the commentary offers explanations for why gold and money are included under these specific categories and not the rest, and this, together with the Chinese text, shows that if it is a corruption it is an old one. I give the commentarial explanations. ",
  "mn26:6.2": "Gold and money are subject to “birth” due to origination in natural cycles. ",
  "mn26:7.2": "Gold and money grow old due to rust or grime. ",
  "mn26:11.2": "Gold and money are liable to corruption by iron, etc. ",
  "mn26:14.1": "This contrasts with the legend that he slipped away in the dead of night. ",
  "mn26:15.1": "At [mn102:25.1](), the “the supreme state of sublime peace” (_santivarapada_) is said to be “liberation without grasping” (_anupādāvimokkha_). ",
  "mn26:15.4": "Interesting reversal of the usual use of āvuso for junior and āyasmā for senior. ",
  "mn26:15.9": "Compare the use of kevalam with -mattena at AN 7.43-3 ",
  "mn26:15.23": "Note how text in this passage varies the verb with upasampajja: pavedeti for Alara, viharati for Gotama. Chalmers, Warren, and Horner get this right, Bodhi and Ṭhānissaro do not. In addition, BB has “in this way” for ettavata here, which is not very accurate. But see MN 79, where we have sacchikato hissa, bhante, ettāvatā ekantasukho loko hotī in a similar context. There he has, “at this point”. Surely the two passages should be translated consistently. ",
  "mn26:16.2": "Note that here the name is omitted. ",
  "mn26:16.30": "Interesting that in the aorist here it switches to abhi-jna ",
  "mn26:21.7": "_Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ_ has long troubled translators, as the basic sense of _pamuñcantu_ is “release”. The problem is a long-standing one, for Sanskrit variants include _pramodantu_ (“celebrate”) or _praṇudantu kāṅkṣāḥ_ (“dispel doubts”). I think it is a poetic variant of _adhimuñcantu_, to “decide” or “commit” to faith; it is extremely common in Pali to use a synonymous verb to reinforce the sense of the noun. In [snp5.19](), _muttasaddho_, _pamuñcassu saddhaṁ_, and _adhimuttacittaṁ_ are all used in this sense. ",
  "mn26:25.21": "According to Cone resolves as ā-han-t-syam, fut. 1 sg. of āhanati = beats. ",
  "mn26:26.3": "The universal agreement among translators that this means “made a pact, agreed” is puzzling, unless they’re reading saññapesum; but I can’t find such a reading. Santhapeti in the sense of “stop” is well established, eg vitakkasanthana. The phrase occurs in a similar context at AN 10.93 + 94, where it refers to the noisy wanderers agreeing to stop talking. There BB renders as “silenced one another”, which is fine in context, but doesn’t necessarily apply here. The common feature of both contexts is that they stop each other (from behaving inappropriately). ",
  "mn26:27.7": "The referent back to “that” here is odd. In fact the identical phrasing occurs at MN 12, where it does, indeed, refer to the austerities just described. Is this a sign of textual loss here? ",
  "mn26:32.3": "This image and the teaching that follows links this sutta with the previous. ",
