  "mn43:4.3": "In defining a noun by its verb, Sāriputta clarifies that consciousness is not an entity but a function. Consciousness is simply the act of being conscious. Similar definitions are proposed for other fundamental Dhamma terms such as “feeling” and “perception”. ",
  "mn43:4.5": "These are fundamental dimensions of the structure of the mind, which are regarded as being always present. ",
  "mn43:5.3": "_Vinibbhujati_ (“disentangle”) is used for the dissection of a corpse [thig16.1:24.1]() or the unravelling of coiled banana sheaths ([mn35:22.3]()). ",
  "mn43:5.4": "“Wisdom” (_paññā_)  and “consciousness” (_viññāṇa_) are two of the very many terms derived from the root _ñā_, “to know”. The prefixes act as intensifiers, but do not decisively distinguish the meaning, so while they are used consistently in doctrinal contexts, more loosely they can be interchangeable. ",
  "mn43:5.9": "Of course they can be distinguished to some degree, but this dialogue cautions against pushing analysis too far. ",
  "mn43:6.4": "This refers to the fundamental distinction made in the first discourse: that which is to be developed (“wisdom”) pertains to the fourth noble truth, while that which is to be completely understood (“consciousness”) pertains to the first noble truth. Again, the distinction between them is functional rather than ontological. ",
  "mn43:7.5": "This definition is similar to that for consciousness. ",
  "mn43:8.5": "“Color” is a more sophisticated and less universal aspect of awareness than ‘feeling”, reflecting the fact that “perception” relates to higher-order functions like recognition and interpretation, which are involved in concept formation. ",
  "mn43:22.3": "For this idiom, cp. SN 46.2 ",
  "mn43:23.1": "Note that this idiom is phrased as tam jivam tam sariram, etc. "
