  "mn20:2.1": "The “higher mind” (_adhicitta_) is the four _jhānas_ ([an3.90:3.1]()). | “Foundation (of meditation)” is _nimitta_, here in its normal meaning: a property of experience that, when focused on, fosters similar properties. | “From time to time” (_kālena kālaṁ_): these are not fundamentals of meditation like mindfulness, which should always be developed, but rather expedients for dealing with specific problems when they arise. A meditator should be familiar with these methods and apply them when needed. However, one should not be over-eager to reach for these methods; they are meant for those times when the normal process of meditation has gone awry. ",
  "mn20:3.1": "Sometimes meditation leads to unwanted results, so for example, one meditating on love might find themselves plagued with thoughts of annoyance. Once the meditator recognizes that this is happening—as per [mn19]()—then this method recommends changing the meditation to something else. ",
  "mn20:4.1": "Note that these methods are progressive; each one assumes that the former method has not worked. | Looking at the drawbacks of unskillful thoughts was the cornerstone of the Bodhisatta’s method at per [mn19:3.4](). ",

  "mn20:5.1": "“Ignore and forget” is _asati-amanasikāra_. | This method shows that it is not always necessary to take every thought seriously. Sometimes it’s better to just ignore it. ",
  "mn20:5.6": "The repetitions here are dubious. The Mahāsaṅgīti edition here and following omits the method that stops the thoughts. It is surely implied, but in the absence of any witnesses, I translate to preserve the roughness of the Pali. ",
  "mn20:6.1": "“Stopping” the formation of thoughts” (_vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṁ_) is a unique phrase which lends the sutta its title. Here _saṅkhāra_ refers to the impetus that drives the formation of thoughts. Understanding the cause helps to deprive it of its power. ",
  "mn20:6.4": "“Walking quickly” like a person swamped by many thoughts ([mn18:16.1]()). ",
  "mn20:6.8": "Multiple methods of quelling thought have failed, so rather than stopping thought all at once, this method focuses on gradually slowing them down. ",
  "mn20:7.2": "Note that both abhinigganh-and abhinippil-occur in Ss2 as physical acts that men and women might perform on each other out of lust. Abhisantap-is not found there; derived from tapas, it is found only in descriptions of Jian-style self-mortification. "
