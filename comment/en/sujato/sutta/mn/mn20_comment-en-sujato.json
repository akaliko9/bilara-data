  "mn20:2.1": "The “higher mind” (_adhicitta_) is the four _jhānas_ ([an3.90:3.1]()). | “Foundation (of meditation)” is _nimitta_, here in its normal meaning: a property of experience that, when focused on, fosters similar properties. | “From time to time” (_kālena kālaṁ_): these are not fundamentals of meditation like mindfulness, which should always be developed, but rather expedients for dealing with specific problems when they arise. A meditator should be familiar with these methods and apply them when needed. However, one should not be over-eager to reach for these methods; they are meant for those times when the normal process of meditation has gone awry. ",
  "mn20:3.1": "Sometimes meditation leads to unwanted results, so for example, one meditating on love might find themselves plagued with thoughts of annoyance. Once the meditator recognizes that this is happening—as per [mn19]()—then this method recommends changing the meditation to something else. ",
  "mn20:4.1": "Note that these methods are progressive; each one assumes that the former method has not worked. | Looking at the drawbacks of unskillful thoughts was the cornerstone of the Bodhisatta’s method at per [mn19:3.4](). ",
  "mn20:4.2": "As per [mn19:3.4](). ",
  "mn20:5.1": "“Ignore and forget” is _asati-amanasikāra_. | This method shows that it is not always necessary to take every thought seriously. Sometimes it’s better to just ignore it. ",
  "mn20:5.6": "The repetitions here are dubious. The Mahāsaṅgīti edition here and following omits the method that stops the thoughts. It is surely implied, but in the absence of any witnesses, I translate to preserve the roughness of the Pali. ",
  "mn20:6.1": "“Stopping” the formation of thoughts” (_vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṁ_) is a unique phrase which lends the sutta its title. Here _saṅkhāra_ refers to the impetus that drives the formation of thoughts. Understanding the cause helps to deprive it of its power. ",
  "mn20:6.4": "“Walking quickly” like a person swamped by many thoughts ([mn18:16.1]()). ",
  "mn20:6.8": "Multiple methods of quelling thought have failed, so rather than stopping thought all at once, this method focuses on gradually slowing them down. Asking “why am I thinking so much?” turns attention around, focusing on the previous thought rather than the next thing. ",
  "mn20:7.2": "This practice is one of the Jain-like mortifying meditations that the Bodhisatta undertook before discovering the middle way ([mn36:20.2](), [mn85:20.2](), [mn100:17.2]()). There, compared to the other practices such as meditating without breathing, it is the first and gentlest. Thus the most gentle of the mortifying meditations is incorporated as the harshest of the Buddhist methods, meant only as a last resort when all other methods have failed. "
