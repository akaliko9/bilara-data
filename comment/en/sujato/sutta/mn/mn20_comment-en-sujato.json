  "mn20:2.1": "The “higher mind” (_adhicitta_) is the four _jhānas_ ([an3.90:3.1]()). | “Foundation (of meditation)” is _nimitta_, here in its normal meaning: a property of experience that, when focused on, fosters similar properties. | “From time to time” (_kālena kālaṁ_): these are not fundamentals of meditation like mindfulness, which should always be developed, but rather expedients for dealing with specific problems when they arise. ",
  "mn20:3.1": "Sometimes meditation leads to unwanted results, so for example, one meditating on love might find themselves plagued with thoughts of annoyance. Once the meditator recognizes that this is happening—as per [mn19]()—then this method recommends changing the meditation to something else. ",
  "mn20:5.6": "The repetitions here are dubious. PTS abbreviates heavily, while MS here and following omits the *action* that causes the thoughts to stop. BB translates as if the action were stated. I would do the same, if I were to find a witness to support it. ",
  "mn20:7.2": "Note that both abhinigganh-and abhinippil-occur in Ss2 as physical acts that men and women might perform on each other out of lust. Abhisantap-is not found there; derived from tapas, it is found only in descriptions of Jian-style self-mortification. "
