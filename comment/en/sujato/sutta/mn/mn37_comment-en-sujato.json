  "mn37:2.1": "A long account of Sakka’s first meeting with the Buddha and conversion is found at [dn21](). There he is said to have attained stream-entry, and so is destined for full awakening. Yet even a stream-enterer may slow their progress by negligence ([snp2.1:9.3]()) | Sakka’s epithet “lord of gods” (_devānamindo_) evokes his more familiar Sanskrit name, Indra. ",
  "mn37:2.2": "This question directly follows on from the final question at [dn21:2.6.9](), where Sakka asks *whether* all ascetics and brahmins have reached the ultimate goal. | This passage has an exact parallel at [an7.61:12.2](), and a variation at [sn35:5.1](). ",
  "mn37:3.2": "The Buddha is calling back to the previous conversation, where immediately before asking about the ultimate goal, Sakka had asked why all ascetics did not share a common doctrine ([dn21:2.6.6]()). The Buddha answered that, though the world has many and diverse elements, ascetics tend to fixate on one aspect and “insist” it is the only truth. ",
  "mn37:3.5": "One who has learned the theory of non-attachment is still liable to become attached, so they apply their knowledge to experiential insight into “all things”. Normally “complete understanding” (_pariññā_) indicates arahantship, but here it reinforces “direct knowledge” (_abhiññā_) as the wisdom of stream-entry. However, the force of attachment is so deeply ingrained that even a stream-enterer, such as Sakka, with both theoretical and experiential wisdom is still not free. So they must then continue to meditate on the feelings in order to let go fully. ",
  "mn37:5.3": "Moggallāna refers to Sakka as a “spirit” (_yakkha_). ",
  "mn37:6.1": "Moggallāna was the foremost in psychic powers. ",
  "mn37:7.1": "BB’s “endowed a hundredfold with the five kinds of heavenly music” is obscure and inaccurate. This is obviously an idiom for a divine amplification of the standard pancangika turiya, translated in AN by BB as “quintet”, which I follow. ",
  "mn37:8.5": "Following Nyanatusita’s suggestion and comm. Here, no = pronoun. ",
  "mn37:9.3": "https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/celestial-maidens-have-nothing-to-be-ashamed-about/3984 ",
  "mn37:10.5": "The gods are pointing out various pretty things (idampi … idampi …) Chalmers and Horner get this right, but BB does not. ",
  "mn37:10.6": "This is a surprisingly knotty idiom. Cp. SN 11.1 and 2, which also include Sakka, the word sobhati, and the idea of making merit in the past. That context draws out the slightly passive-aggressive nature of what Moggallana says here; he’s kind of praising him for having made merit, but also kind of criticizing him for living off his past. The verb sobhati in such cases is very idiomatic. Nyanatusita suggests “befits”, which apparently BB adopts in Connected Discourses. But I think the idea is that it looks nice for someone like Sakka (who is interested in such things). ",
  "mn37:11.7": "BB’s “heavenly region” is incorrect. bhavana is used for the home of a divine being, eg SN 10.1, AN 6.54 ",
  "mn37:14.2": "BB has “attendants”, but it is feminine plural nominative, as previously. ",
  "mn37:14.8": "BB’s “how much more so that …” is incorrect. Aho nuna … means “Surely that must be …”. The maidens are expressing their amazement that anyone but Moggallana might be the teacher. 'We can't belive that …' is not literal, but is less confusing in English. "
