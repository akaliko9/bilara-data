  "mn21:2.1": "This monk appears in three discourses, in none of which he distinguishes himself. At [sn12.12]() he persistently attempts to rephrase questions on dependent origination in terms of a self. And at [sn12.32]() Venerable Sāriputta gets word that Phagguna had disrobed. | According to the commentary, he was called Phagguna “of the Top-Knot” because of the style he wore his hair as a layperson. The name stuck, presumably to distinguish him from the Phagguna of [an6.56]() (and probably [sn35.83]()) who died in robes as a non-returner after hearing a Dhamma talk. ",
  "mn21:2.3": "A “disciplinary proceeding” (_adhikaraṇa_) is a legal case in Vinaya. A standard set of four is listed at [mn104:12.3](). The kind of case is not specified in the text, but the commentary says they accused other mendicants of various offences and got Vinaya experts to litigate them, making it a “disciplinary issue arising from accusations” (_anuvādādhikaraṇa_, [pli-tv-kd14:14.2.7]()).

  "mn21:6.10": "The grammar here is a little obscure, and the various translations evidence this. Chalmer’s is the only clearly correct one: the Buddha is applying the Golden rule, starting with the nuns, then to phagguna. Horner misses the shift in object and simply repeats verbatim. BB, following Nyanamoli, has “speaks dispraise in your presence”, without clarifying dispraise of who. But in the next passage, “you” is specified as object. In both passages, we should read tava (genitive) as playing the same role as bhikkhuninam in the former passages. The confusion comes because the genitive plays two roles in the passages, with sammukha and as the object of criticism/blows. These passages inherit tava as used in the former sense but apply it in the latter. In the next passage sammukha is omitted, presumably because it is unnecessary to specify being hit in your own presence. ",
