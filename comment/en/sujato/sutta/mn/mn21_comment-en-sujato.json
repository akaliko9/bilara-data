  "mn21:2.1": "This monk appears in three discourses, in none of which he distinguishes himself. At [sn12.12]() he persistently attempts to rephrase questions on dependent origination in terms of a self. And at [sn12.32]() Venerable Sāriputta gets word that Phagguna had disrobed. | According to the commentary, he was called Phagguna “of the Top-Knot” because of the style he wore his hair as a layperson. The name stuck, presumably to distinguish him from the Phagguna of [an6.56]() (and probably [sn35.83]()) who died in robes as a non-returner after hearing a Dhamma talk. ",
  "mn21:2.3": "A “disciplinary proceeding” (_adhikaraṇa_) is a legal case in Vinaya. A standard set of four is listed at [mn104:12.3](). The kind of case is not specified in the text, but the commentary says they accused other mendicants of various offences and got Vinaya experts to litigate them, making it a “disciplinary issue arising from accusations” (_anuvādādhikaraṇa_, [pli-tv-kd14:14.2.7]()).

  "mn21:6.6": "This does not mean, of course, that one should not defend people against violence (see eg. [dn16:1.4.15]()), but that even in such circumstances one should not give way to anger. ",
  "mn21:6.10": "The grammar here is a little tricky. The genitive plays two roles in these passages: specifying the context (_tava sammukhā_, “in your presence”), and as the object of criticism or blows (_pahāraṁ dadeyya_ “if they strike” operates above on “those nuns” (_tāsaṁ bhikkhunīnaṁ_) and below on “you” (_tava_)). Here we would expect both senses to be used, but the text only has _tava_ once. Either the repetition has been lost or it is assumed it will be distributed. ",
  "mn21:6.13": "Here _sammukhā_ is omitted, as it is unnecessary to specify being hit in your own presence. ",
  "mn21:7.4": "In more detail at [mn65:2.1](). This is referring to the early years of the dispensation, before the formal Vinaya code was laid down. The Buddha was reluctant to create a legal code and did so only when it became necessary ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.4.6]()). ",
  "mn21:7.7": "This is how the Buddha leads: not with judgment and punishment, but by reason, positive encouragement, and inspiring with his own example. ",
  "mn21:7.10": "This simile is also at [mn119:31.2](), [sn35.239:2.10](), and [an5.28:10.2](). ",
  "mn21:8.1": "This is a unique simile. ",
  "mn21:9.1": "The lady Vedehikā is known only here. According to the commentary, her name means either “daughter of the lady from Videha”, or (implausibly) “wise one”. However, the much earlier Arthaśāstra treats _vaidehika_ either as a “merchant” (2.21.7) or as a caste name (3.7.32). ",
  "mn21:9.3": "The same set of three in a similar context occur at [an6.60](). ",
  "mn21:9.4": "According to ancient Indian law (Arthaśāstra 3.13), slaves may be born such, be captured in war, or a person in a time of trouble may bind themselves in service for a fee. Non-Aryans (_mleccha_) may indenture their children, but this is forbidden for Aryans. Such bondservants were protected against cruelty, sexual abuse, and unfair work. After earning back the fee of their indenture they were freed, retaining their original inheritance and status. | The maid’s name means “black” (compare the Kāḷī at [thag2.16:1.1]() who “looks like a crow”). This is a persistent pattern in early Pali. The only other named slaves are Disā (“foe”, [dn3:1.16.1]()), her son Kaṇha (“black”, [dn3:1.16.1]()), and Kāka (“crow”, [pli-tv-kd8:1.26.6]()). These people were evidently non-Aryans descended from the native peoples of India, perhaps Tamils or other tribal groups. ",
  "mn21:9.13": "This is an idiomatic and disrespectful form of address. _He_ is an exclamation for calling attention, like “hey” but cruder. _Je_ is a derogatory term for women, used here and by the Vajjīs to Ambapālī at [dn16:2.16.3](). ",
