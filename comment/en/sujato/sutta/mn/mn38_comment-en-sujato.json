  "mn38:2.2": "Sāti attributes three teachings to the Buddha. First, that there is a “transmigration” (_saṁsāra_)  from one life to another. Second, that the primary locus of transmigration is “consciousness” (_viññāṇa_). And thirdly, that the consciousness that transmigrates remains “this very same” (_tadevidaṁ_), not another (_anaññaṁ_); in other words, it retains its self-same identity through the process of rebirth. The Buddha did in fact teach the first two of these ideas, but not the third, as he will explain below. | The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad similarly says that as death approaches, the senses and vital energies withdraw into the heart (_hṛdaya_), from the top of which the self departs. That same consciousness proceeds to a new body (4.4.2: _savijñāno bhavati, savijñānamevānvavakrāmati_). This core Upaniṣadic chapter on rebirth reflects Sāti’s wording as well as his meaning. Sāti asserts emphatic identity using doubled demonstrative pronouns conjoined with _(e)va_ (_tadevidaṁ_), and identical constructions are found throughout the Bṛhadāraṇyaka chapter: _sa vā ayam_ (4.4.5), _sa vā eṣa_ (4.4.22, 4.4.24, 4.4.25); see also _tameva_ (4.4.17). For _anaññaṁ_ we find the inverse _anya_ for the “other” body (4.4.3, 4.4.4). For the Pali verbs _sandhāvati saṁsarati_ we have instead _avakrāmati_ (4.4.1, 4.4.2). But the connection with _saṁsarati_ is made in the Brahmanical tradition itself, for it says below, “That self is indeed divinity, made of consciousness” (_sa vā ayamātmā brahma vijñānamayo_; 4.4.5, see too 4.4.22), which the commentator Śaṅkara explains as “the transmigrating self” (_saṁsaratyātmā_). ",
  "mn38:3.10": "If consciousness is dependent it is changeable and cannot be “that very same”. The Buddha spoke of consciousness as a process of phenomena evolving and flowing, ever changing like a stream. ",
  "mn38:5.11": "See [mn2:8.8](). ",
  "mn38:6.3": "See [mn22:7.3](). ",
  "mn38:7.7": "",
  "mn38:8.1": "The Buddha’s use of duplicated pronouns with _eva_ here echoes Sāti’s language, but to the opposite effect. Rather than emphasizing the self-sameness of transmigrating consciousness, the Buddha states with equal emphasis the dependence of consciousness on specific conditions, whatever they may be. ",
  "mn38:9.1": "“This has come to be” (_bhūtamidaṁ_) refers to dependently originated consciousness (implied by the neuter pronoun _idaṁ_). See [12.31:7.1](). ",

  "mn38:14.1": "An allusion to [mn22:13.1](). The verbs here are used of children playing with sandcastles at [sn23.2:2.2](). ",
  "mn38:15.3": "As at [mn9:11.4](). ",
  "mn38:16.1": "The word _āhāra_ (“fuel”, “food”, “nutriment”) means literally “intake”, and is etymologically parallel to _upādāna_, “grasping”, “uptake”. Both terms have dual senses, on the one hand denoting fuel or sustenance, and on the other grasping and attachment. That is why here (as at [mn9:11.5]()), _āhāra_ is created by craving, just like _upādāna_ in the standard sequence ([mn38:17.8]()). ",
  "mn38:17.1": "Here begins the full presentation of the standard sequence of dependent origination in forward order. I supply definitions mostly from [sn12.2]() and briefly indicate the nature of the conditioned links. | Because we are ignorant of the four noble truths, we make morally potent choices by body, speech, and mind.

  "mn38:23.4": "PTS has ādhav-. In the related passage at SN 12.20 we find apadhav-and upadhav-. Regardless of the exact reading, it seems clear the intent was to express the opposite direction to patidhav-. ",
  "mn38:24.2": "The shift to singular seems unjustified. ",
  "mn38:24.8": "Readings here are problematic, and comm is no help. PTS has: “samaṇo no evamāha, samaṇā ca na ca mayaṁ evaṁ vadema”, which is followed by most translators, eg BB “The recluse says this, and so do [other] recluses, but we do not speak thus.” But I am not persuaded. The double samano/samanā idiom is odd, as is why it suddenly shifts to the negative. MS has nāma for na ca, which suggests reading samanā as ablative, paralleling the syntax of the previous section. In this case nāma becomes emphatic. Note, too, that the more common idiom is samano no garu. I think PTS is probably right in including the no here, again paralleling the previous passage. I even wonder if nāma is not a garbling of namo or some variant, paralleling garu? It is possible, of course, that na ca was normalized to nāma in MS. But in the previous passage we have satthugārave*na ca*, so it is more likely the “na ca” was inherited from there. This is not dissimilar to Ṭhānissaro’s rendering: “The Contemplative says this. We speak thus in line with the Contemplative’s words” ",
  "mn38:26.1": "Bodhi’s “womb” here is incorrect; he fixes this in AN 3.61. ",
  "mn38:27.1": "This use of samsaya is unusual. Comm says “Saṁsayenāti ‘‘arogo nu kho bhavissāmi ahaṁ vā, putto vā me’’ti evaṁ mahantena jīvitasaṁsayena” For jivitasamsaya and pranasamsaya, Skt has “risk to life”. The term appears at Bi Pc 61, where garubhara is an adjective (garubhārā ayyā = the lady is heavy with child). Nowhere, apparently, is the term glossed in the comm. This passage is also missing in Cone and PTS dict, though perhaps they do not treat it as a compound. | The notion that the term of pregnancy was “nine or ten months” is also found at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.9.1.

  "mn38:30.1": "Note that SN in parallels for this passage has adhimuccati rather than sarajjati. ",
  "mn38:41.11": "Given that it occurs quite a few times, I take the phrase sankhittena tanhasankhayavimutti as an idiom referring to the brief statement made at the beginning, as also in MN 37. "
