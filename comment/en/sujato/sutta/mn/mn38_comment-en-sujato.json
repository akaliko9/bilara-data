  "mn38:2.2": "This view attributes a number of teachings to the Buddha. First, that there is a “transmigration” (_saṁsāra_)  from one life to another. Second, that the primary locus of transmigration is “consciousness” (_viññāṇa_). And thirdly, that the consciousness that transmigrates remains “this very same” (_tadevidaṁ_), not another (_anaññaṁ_); in other words, it retains its self-same identity through the process of rebirth. The Buddha teaches the first two of these ideas, but not the third, as he will explain below. | The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad says that as death approaches, the senses and vital energies withdraw into the heart (_hṛdaya_), from the top of which the self departs. That same consciousness proceeds to a new body (4.4.2: _savijñāno bhavati, savijñānamevānvavakrāmati_), together with wisdom, karma, and past experience. Not only is the idea of self-same consciousness the same as Sāti’s, but this passage—a core Upaniṣadic text on rebirth—reflects Sāti’s wording as well. Sāti asserts emphatic identity using doubled demonstrative pronouns conjoined with _(e)va_ (_tadevidaṁ_). Identical constructions are found throughout the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad passage: _sa vā ayam_ (4.4.5), _sa vā eṣa_ (4.4.22, 4.4.24, 4.4.25); see also _tameva_ (4.4.17). For _anaññaṁ_ we find the inverse _anya_ for the “other” body (4.4.3, 4.4.4). For the Pali verbs _sandhāvati saṁsarati_ we have instead _avakrāmati_ (4.4.1, 4.4.2). But the connection with _saṁsarati_ is made in the Brahmanical tradition itself, for it is further said that “That self is indeed divinity, made of consciousness” (_sa vā ayamātmā brahma vijñānamayo_; 4.4.5, see too 4.4.22), which the commentator Śaṅkara explains as “the transmigrating self” (_saṁsaratyātmā_).

  "mn38:23.4": "PTS has ādhav-. In the related passage at SN 12.20 we find apadhav-and upadhav-. Regardless of the exact reading, it seems clear the intent was to express the opposite direction to patidhav-. ",
  "mn38:24.2": "The shift to singular seems unjustified. ",
  "mn38:24.8": "Readings here are problematic, and comm is no help. PTS has: “samaṇo no evamāha, samaṇā ca na ca mayaṁ evaṁ vadema”, which is followed by most translators, eg BB “The recluse says this, and so do [other] recluses, but we do not speak thus.” But I am not persuaded. The double samano/samanā idiom is odd, as is why it suddenly shifts to the negative. MS has nāma for na ca, which suggests reading samanā as ablative, paralleling the syntax of the previous section. In this case nāma becomes emphatic. Note, too, that the more common idiom is samano no garu. I think PTS is probably right in including the no here, again paralleling the previous passage. I even wonder if nāma is not a garbling of namo or some variant, paralleling garu? It is possible, of course, that na ca was normalized to nāma in MS. But in the previous passage we have satthugārave*na ca*, so it is more likely the “na ca” was inherited from there. This is not dissimilar to Ṭhānissaro’s rendering: “The Contemplative says this. We speak thus in line with the Contemplative’s words” ",
  "mn38:26.1": "Bodhi’s “womb” here is incorrect; he fixes this in AN 3.61. ",
  "mn38:27.1": "This use of samsaya is unusual. Comm says “Saṁsayenāti ‘‘arogo nu kho bhavissāmi ahaṁ vā, putto vā me’’ti evaṁ mahantena jīvitasaṁsayena” For jivitasamsaya and pranasamsaya, Skt has “risk to life”. The term appears at Bi Pc 61, where garubhara is an adjective (garubhārā ayyā = the lady is heavy with child). Nowhere, apparently, is the term glossed in the comm. This passage is also missing in Cone and PTS dict, though perhaps they do not treat it as a compound. | The notion that the term of pregnancy was “nine or ten months” is also found at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.9.1.
