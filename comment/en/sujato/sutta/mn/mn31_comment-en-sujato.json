  "mn31:1.1": "This discourse is a favorite among monastics, depicting an ideal life of simplicity and friendship. The same introduction occurs at [pli-tv-kd10:4.2.1]() and, with a different teaching portion, at [mn128:81](). In both those cases it is set after the Buddha left the quarreling monks of Kosambi. Perhaps it was reused, or perhaps the events there were simply split into two accounts. ",
  "mn31:1.2": "Ñātika (also spelled _nātika_, or _nādika_; Sanskrit _jñātṛka_; Prākrit _nāyika_) is the the clan to which the Jain leader Mahāvīra (called Nāṭaputta, i.e. Ñātiputta) belonged. This is the chief town of the clan. (See [dn16:2.5.1]()). | Over a millennium previously, the Indus Valley Civilization had built cities of fired brick with standardized size and construction methods, but in the Buddha’s day most buildings were wood. This is the only brick building mentioned in the suttas; brick construction is also discussed in the Vinaya. ",
  "mn31:2.1": "Anuruddha was the brother of Ānanda and Mahānāma ([pli-tv-kd17:1.1.3]()) which, according to the commentary, makes the Buddha his cousin. He was an exponent of mindfulness meditation ([sn52.1](), etc.) and master of clairvoyance ([an1.192:1.1](). | Kimbila was one of the group of seven leading Sakyans, including Anuruddha and Ānanda, who went forth together ([pli-tv-kd17:1.4.1]()). | Several Nandiyas are known in the suttas, one of whom was a Sakyan ([sn55.40](), [an11.13](); the root _nand_ (“joy”) was a popular choice for Sakyan names: Ānanda, Nanda, Upananda). While Nandiya is not mentioned as having gone forth with the seven, Kimbila refers to their group as the “Sakyan friends” in his verses at [thag2.18](), so it seems likely he was indeed the Sakyan Nandiya; perhaps he went forth later than his friends. ",
  "mn31:3.2": "This is one of several instances showing that the Buddha looked like an ordinary ascetic (see also [dn2:11.2](), [mn140:5.11]()). ",
  "mn31:3.5": "_Attakāmarūpa_ is glossed by the commentary as “those whose nature is to desire their own welfare”. Most translators render this as “seeking their own good” or similar. But this erases the unique and striking phrasing, which draws on Yājnavalkya’s description of one whose form is such that, having attained their only desire, the Self, has become without desire (_ātmakāmam āptakāmam akāmaṁ rūpaṁ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.7.1.21, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.21. Cf. _niṣkāma āptakāma ātmakāmo_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.7.2.8, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.6 . In both cases the Bṛhadāraṇyaka reverses the sequence of _āpta_ … _ātma_.) This describes a sage who is fully immersed in the realization of Brahman in death or dreamless sleep. Here the suffix _-rūpa_ does not mean “seemingly”, nor is it to be discarded as a mere idiom, but has the sense given in the commentary, a person’s true form or true nature (_sabhāva_). This is, of course, not a Buddhist concept. But it is spoken by the keeper of a park (not a monastery) who fails to even recognize the Buddha. There is no reason he should be Buddhist. To this day, Buddhist monastics are received with kindness and unhesitatingly supported by Hindus, who readily interpret and describe the monastics’ practice in their own terms. ",
  "mn31:5.7": "The text refers to “Anuruddhas” in plural. It was apparently the custom to refer to the group by their most senior member. ",
  "mn31:8.2": "Normally I would render viharati in such idioms as “meditate”. But Anuruddha’s response avoids talking about meditation. I think he is deliberately avoiding the topic due to his reticence, skirting the obvious intended meaning by seizing on an ambiguity. His reticence is distinctly reminiscent of Yajnavalka’s reticence with Janaka on the topic of a person’s light. ",
  "mn31:9.7": "https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-holding-hands/5184 ",
  "mn31:9.9": "Here the Vinaya account ends, as it is concerned with the settlement of the quarrel among the monks of Kosambi. ",
  "mn31:10.3": "This idiom seems to only occur in emphatic contexts, so BB’s “why not” seems too weak. ",
  "mn31:11-13.2": "BB has “by surmounting”, but samatikkamaya must be dative, not instrumental. samatikkamaya is regularly used in this sense, eg samatikkamaya samvattati, “leads to going beyond”. "
