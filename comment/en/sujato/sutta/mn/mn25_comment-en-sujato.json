  "mn25:2.1": "“Sower sows seed” renders the triplicated expression _nevāpiko nivāpaṁ nivapati_. The root sense of _vap_ is to “cast down” or “sow” seed; it is also used of offerings to ancestors. It is tempting to translate as a “trapper” who lays “bait”, but the Pali terms don’t have the same connotations. The aim of the “sower” is simply to grow a crop, and to do this they need to keep the deer out. That is the guile of the story: they appear harmless. | For an amicable solution to this problem, see the conclusion to the Rurumigarāja Jātaka ([ja482]()) | _Migajāta_ might be better translated as “wild animals” here. ",
  "mn25:5.20": "The repeated use of _nāma_ is strongly emphatic. | _Parajana_ sometimes means “another person” ([mil6.3.1:13.2]()), but the commentary here glosses it as _yakkha_, and a _yakkha_ named Parajana makes an appearance in ([mn31:21.1]()). Presumably it has a sense not dissimilar to _amanussa_, “non-human”. ",
  "mn25:5.22": "_Vākarā_ (variant _vāgurā_, which is also the Sanskrit form) is a net or snare, which here is staked out on sticks. The deer would have to leap over it, revealing their position. | _Gāha_ here is from _√gāh_ (“deep place, hidey-hole”) rather than _√gah_ (“take”). ",
  "mn25:9.5": "Following this the Mahāsaṅgīti edition has a ghost sentence, formed by adding the first part of the subsequent sentence with the second part of the previous. It is absent from the PTS text. ",
  "mn25:9.6": "",
  "mn25:9.11": "“Heart’s release” (_cetovimutti_) is a term for meditative absorptions as listed below. | While these meditators did indeed escape Māra for a while, the malnourishment of their bodies undermined their freedom of mind. From the point of view of the eightfold path, they were neglecting right livelihood, which for a mendicant is relying on alms. This not only ensures adequate nutrition, it helps build community and spread the Dhamma. | For the dependency of absorption on food, see also the Buddha’s account of his own practice before awakening ([mn36:33.2]()). ",
  "mn25:10.20": "For more on these speculative views, see [mn63]() and [mn72](). ",
  "mn25:12.3": "The previous meditators embarked on unsustainable physical seclusion, which ultimately drew them back to Māra’s clutches. Here the meditators are practicing the middle way, where it is seclusion of mind rather than body that is key. In the eightfold path, the seclusion of mind builds on the balanced practice of ethics, including right livelihood, ensuring a sustainable way of life, neither too intimate not too secluded. And it is this balanced and holistic development that leads to the lasting freedom from defilements. ",
  "mn25:20.1": "The “cessation of perception and feeling” (_saññāvedayitanirodha_) is a culminating meditation state of supreme subtlety that leads directly to awakening. The state itself, like all meditation states, is temporary, but following it the defilements are gone forever. "
