  "mn25:2.1": "“Sower sows seed” renders the triplicated expression _nevāpiko nivāpaṁ nivapati_. The root sense of _vap_ is to “cast down” or “sow” seed; it is also used of offerings to ancestors. It is tempting to translate as a “trapper” who lays “bait”, but the Pali terms don’t have the same connotations. The aim of the “sower” is simply to grow a crop, and to do this they need to keep the deer out. That is the guile of the story: they appear harmless. | For an amicable solution to this problem, see the conclusion to the Rurumigarāja Jātaka ([ja482]()) | _Migajāta_ might be better translated as “wild animals” here. ",
  "mn25:5.20": "The repeated use of _nāma_ is strongly emphatic. | _Parajana_ sometimes means “another person” ([mil6.3.1:13.2]()), but the commentary here glosses it as _yakkha_, and a _yakkha_ named Parajana makes an appearance in ([mn31:21.1]()). Presumably it has a sense not dissimilar to _amanussa_, “non-human”. ",
  "mn25:5.22": "_Vākarā_ (variant _vāgurā_, which is also the Sanskrit form) is a net or snare, which here is staked out on sticks. The deer would have to leap over it, revealing their position. | _Gāha_ here is from _√gāh_ (“deep place, hidey-hole”) rather than _√gah_ (“take”). ",
  "mn25:9.5": "Following this the Mahāsaṅgīti edition has a ghost sentence, formed by adding the first part of the subsequent sentence with the second part of the previous. It is absent from the PTS text. ",

  "mn25:9.11": "“Heart’s release” (_cetovimutti_) is a term for meditative absorptions, as listed below. For the dependency of absorption on food, see also the Buddha’s account of his own practice before awakening ([mn36:33.2]()). ",
