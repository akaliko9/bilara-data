  "mn23:1.3": "“Kassapa the Prince” (Kumārakassapa) was ordained at twenty ([Kd 1:75.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#75.1.1)). He features in the Pāyāsisutta ([dn23]()), and his verses are collected in the Theragāthā ([thag2.41]()). He was declared the foremost of those with brilliant speech ([an1.217]()). | The Dark Forest (_andhavana_) was a thick grove near Sāvatthī often visited by monks and nuns for meditation. ",
  "mn23:1.4": "This kind of divine manifestation happens throughout the suttas, but most characteristically in the Sagāthavagga, the opening book of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. Typically the deity will speak some verse, but here she offers a series of obscure riddles, almost like a dream sequence. The deliberate use of obscurity is a hallmark of Brahmanical literature, for “the gods love hidden things” (_parokṣakāmā hi devāḥ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.6.2.2 and throughout). This harks back to the Rig Veda, which employed a fantastic wealth of literary techniques to enliven the simple procedure of the ritual, by which means the poets strove to attract the gods to their specific ritual. ",
  "mn23:2.1": "Worship of anthills and the deadly snakes they harbor is still common in India today, and is probably pre-Vedic. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa acknowledges a ritual significance to the anthill as a creative manifestation of the earth upon which offerings may be laid and whose ants were divine (2.6.2.17, 6.3.3.5, 14.1.2.10). In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.7, Yājñavalkya compares a dead body bereft of soul to the lifeless slough of a snake on an anthill. | While anthills don’t “fume” and “flame”, they do leverage the temperature differential of day and night to create convection flows that regulate temperature and flush carbon dioxide. ",
  "mn23:2.4": "langi is uncertain; the primary sense seems to be ’sticking point'. ",
  "mn23:2.19": "cangavara is uncertain. But the pun below evidently connects vara with nivarana, so the sense of “box” fits better with “hindrance” than does “sieve”. ",
  "mn23:4.4": "quotes on manasa are a mistake. "
