He features in the Pāyāsisutta ([dn23]()), and his verses are collected in the Theragāthā ([thag2.41]()). He was declared the foremost of those with brilliant speech ([an1.217]()). | The Dark Forest (_andhavana_) was a thick grove near Sāvatthī often resorted to by monks and nuns for meditation. ",

  "mn23:2.19": "cangavara is uncertain. But the pun below evidently connects vara with nivarana, so the sense of “box” fits better with “hindrance” than does “sieve”. ",
  "mn23:4.4": "quotes on manasa are a mistake. "
