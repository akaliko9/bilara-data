  "mn23:1.3": "“Kassapa the Prince” (Kumārakassapa) was ordained at twenty ([Kd 1:75.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#75.1.1)). He features in the Pāyāsisutta ([dn23]()), and his verses are collected in the Theragāthā ([thag2.41]()). He was declared the foremost of those with brilliant speech ([an1.217]()). | The Dark Forest (_andhavana_) was a thick grove south of Sāvatthī often visited by monks and nuns for meditation. ",
  "mn23:1.4": "This kind of divine manifestation happens throughout the suttas, but most characteristically in the Sagāthavagga, the opening book of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. Typically the deity will speak some verse, but here she offers a series of obscure riddles full of secret meaning, almost like a dream sequence. The deliberate use of obscurity is a hallmark of Brahmanical literature, for “the gods love hidden things” (_parokṣakāmā hi devāḥ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.6.2.2 and throughout). ",
  "mn23:2.1": "Worship of anthills and the deadly snakes they harbor is still common in India today and is probably pre-Vedic. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa acknowledges a ritual significance to the anthill as a creative manifestation of the earth upon which offerings may be laid and whose ants were divine (2.6.2.17, 6.3.3.5, 14.1.2.10). In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.7, Yājñavalkya compares a dead body bereft of soul to the lifeless slough of a snake on an anthill. | While anthills don’t “fume” and “flame”, large termite mounds leverage the temperature differential of day and night to create convection flows that regulate temperature and flush carbon dioxide. ",
  "mn23:2.3": "The sword is taken up, a symbol whose roots lie in the discovery of metal smelting and the power this grants to the one who wields the sword. But the phrase has a double meaning, for _sattha_ means both “sword” and “sacred treatise”, while _abhikkhaṇa_ means both “dig” (_abhi_ + _√khaṇ_) and “see” (_abhi_ + _√ikkh_; this sense not in Pali, but cf. Vedic _abhikhyā_). Thus, having entered the Dark Wood, he is urged to use the wisdom of scripture in order to see. ",
  "mn23:2.4": "_Laṅgi_ occurs only here, and is glossed by the commentary with _paligha_ (“obstacle”). Such an obscure term must have been selected for a play on words. Sanskrit _lagna_ has the primary sense “to stick, adhere”, while also having a sense of the beginning or coming into contact with something. In modern languages such as Hindi, Marathi, or Kannada it has taken on the sense of “marriage”, and perhaps here we see an anticipation of this. If we are on the right track, the _laṅgi_ would be the initial challenge for a mendicant seeker, namely their attachment to family. This would explain why it is the first obstacle. ",
  "mn23:2.9": "The male Indian bullfrog possesses a pair of prominent dark-blue vocal sacs that puff up and down as it croaks, hence the Pali name _uddhumāyika_ (“puffer”). This probably inspired the connection with anger, as explained below, the bullfrog evoking those renunciates who become puffed up (_uddhata_) and argumentative over doctrines. | Rig Veda 7.10 is addressed to frogs, who lie fallow in the dry but spring to life in the rains, filling the countryside with their amorous croaks, like the brahman priests reciting their verses and passing them down to students. ",
  "mn23:2.14": "Rig Veda 10.88.15 speaks of the two paths of gods and mortals (_devānām uta martyānām_), later formalized as the path of the forefathers (_pitṛyāna_) leading to rebirth and that of the gods (_devayāna_) leading to liberation. This corresponds to the twofold choice of the young Siddhattha: to stay at home or to go forth. ",
  "mn23:2.19": "_Caṅgavāra_ is a filter through which, according to [ja525:29.2](), water drips away like the brief days of our lives. The commentary in both places says that such alkaline (_khāra_) filters were used by laundrymen. This refers to the traditional method of creating lye (a soap precursor) for washing, where a barrel is filled with wood ash through which water is passed. No matter how much many pots of water are added, the commentary adds, it keeps driping. ",
  "mn23:2.24": "As described in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 7.5.1, a tortoise was placed on the altar to represent the primordial powers of creation: the sap of life, the sun, the breath, and the act of creation itself. Its lower and upper shells and its body in-between correspond to the three worlds: the earth, the heavens, and the midspace. It therefore connotes the ancient, endless movement of life. ",
  "mn23:2.29": "In this brutal simile, _asi_ is a knife and _sūna_ is a place where animals are slaughtered, either a slaughterhouse or, as here, an implement for the slaughter. [mnd1:23.18]() says this phrase has the meaning of “chopping” (_adhikuṭṭanaṭṭhena_). Compare with _asiṁ sūnāṁ_ in the violent, sexually graphic hymn at Rig Veda 10.86.18c (where, however, Jamison and Brereton translate _sūna_ as a “basket” for carrying the flesh of a slaughtered beast). Jamison and Brereton read the Vedic passage as an analogy for the horse sacrifice, at the climax of which the queen has vulgar and very public sex with the dead horse. This cements in the most explicit way possible the oneness of sexual potency with the cycle of life and death. ",
  "mn23:2.32": "",
  "mn23:4.4": "quotes on manasa are a mistake. ",
  "mn23:4.19": "The commentary says that, just as water continually drips through such a filter, the mind of someone beset by the five hindrances cannot stay fixed internally on what is wholesome. This contrasts with the mind in absorption, which is illustrated with similes of water that emphasize stillness and containment ([dn2:76.1](), etc.). ",
  "mn23:4.23": "The five aggregates are the tortoise’s five limbs, with consciousness as the head. The aggregates represent the changing world of conditions driven by karma, just as the tortoise is the creative force and life of the three worlds. In samādhi, the senses are withdrawn like a tortoise’s limbs. ",
  "mn23:4.27": "This brutal simile is per the previous sutta ((mn22:3.16]()). "
