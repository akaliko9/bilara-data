  "mn33:2.1": "Since organizing teachings by number is the hallmark of the Aṅguttara Nikāya, it comes as no surprise to see this pattern repeated in the Book of the Elevens at [an11.17](), [an11.22](), and [an11.502-981](). ",
  "mn33:2.3": "“Knowing form” (_rūpaññū _) means being able to keep track of the herd by reckoning or recognizing them. | “Ford” is _tittha_, i.e. a way to get across. | “Smoke out pests” is _dhūmaṁ kattā_, referring to the traditional practice of warding off flies and other  pests by burning cow dung, etc. | “Satisfy” is _pīta_, which is less literal than “drink”, but clarifies the simile later on.
