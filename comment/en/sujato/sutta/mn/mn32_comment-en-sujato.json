  "mn32:4.7": "Ānanda was renowned as the most learned monk in the Sangha ([an1.219](). ",
  "mn32:4.8": "Typically inclusive, Ānanda mentions the four assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. ",
  "mn32:5.6": "There were two prominent Revatas in the early Sangha. There was Revata of the Acacia Wood, who was said to be the foremost of forest dwellers ([an1.203]()); [thag14.1](), [thag1.42]()). But this is probably Revata the Doubter, who was the most skilled in _jhāna_ ([an1.204](); [thag1.3]()). Early in his monastic life he struggled with doubt over small maters ([pli-tv-kd6:16.1.1]()). He overcame this ([ud5.7]()), but the name stuck. ",

This power is compared in the Majjhima to a man standing between two doors watching people come to and fro ([mn39:20.3](), [mn77:35.2](), [mn130:2.1]()), and in the Dīgha with someone in a longhouse watching people move about in the town square ([dn2:96.1](), [dn10:2.33.1]()).

  "mn32:8.6": "Despite BB’s note, there is no reason to think this passage refers to the “abhidhamma”. Note that in the second part of the passage it simply refers to dhammi katha, i.e. dhamma discussion. Here, as usual in the EBTs, abhidhamma means, not “higher Dhamma “but” about the teaching”. "
