  "mn128:6.22": "Yamamase is an imperative, 'we must control ourselves'. Both in Thag 4.3 and Thag 8.1, however, the context clearly indicates that a pun on Yama, the god of death, is intended. This is confirmed by the commentary, see Norman's note on Thag 4.3. I try to translate in a way that captures both 'must restrain ourselves' and 'we will go to presence of Death'. ",
  "mn128:6.27": "Like Dhananjani ",
  "mn128:7.1": "I think this means “child salt-workers”. Note that in the only other occurrence of lonakara, at AN 4.188, it is loṇakāradārako. However the readings are uncertain. Nevertheless, child salt miners are sadly common in India even today, so I translate in empathy with them. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7305988/Salt-mining-leaves-bitter-taste-for-Indian-workers.html ",

  "mn128:15.3": "As in [mn31](), Anuruddha is reluctant to reveal the full extent of his meditation, and must be prodded, reminiscent of Yājñavalkya’s reticence to answer Janaka. What is even more striking is that Janaka asks about a person’s light (_kiṁjyotirayaṁ puruṣa_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.1). Yājñavalkya answers that it is simply the sun, and when pressed further, the moon, and only reluctantly admits that a person’s true light is their self, made of consciousness, the light in the heart. This is the same self that we have noted above is referred to in the phrase _attakāmarūpa_. What makes these connections even more intriguing is that the Vedantic commentator Śaṅkara, on a verse of the same chapter (4.3.7), launches into an extended discussion based on objections to his doctrine by Buddhists. Thus the Buddhist text looks back to the Upaniṣad, while the commentary to that same Upaniṣad looks to the Buddhists. ",
  "mn128:15.5": "Comm: Tañca nimittaṁ nappaṭivijjhāmāti tañca kāraṇaṁ na jānāma, yena no obhāso ca rūpadassanañca antaradhāyati. Note that even the commentary here takes nimitta in the sense of “reason”, not “nimitta”. For related contexts, see AN 6.55, AN 8.70 ",
  "mn128:16.8": "While it is not always possible to represent tenses literally, I feel that here the switch from past to present is significant. It is recalling an episode in the past in order to infer a universal principle. "
