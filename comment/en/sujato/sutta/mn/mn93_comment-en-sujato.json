  "mn93:3.1": "While this description is similar to that of brahmin students such as Ambaṭṭha ([dn3:1.3.1]()), it is only here and at [mn95:11.2]() that we find the additional details that they are tonsured and sixteen years of age. | “Tonsured” (_vuttasira_) literally means “circlehead” and it refers to the practice of shaving off all but a topknot (cf. _nivṛttacūḍaka_ at Manusmṛiti 5.67). According to Manusmṛiti 2.65, the ceremony of tonsure (there called _keśānta_) is to be given to brahmins at sixteen, so this must be meant here. Contrast the usual brahmanical pejorative of _muṇḍaka_ (“shaveling”, [mn81:6.8]()). ",
  "mn93:5.12": "Brahmins assumed the superiority of the fair-skinned northerners of Indo-Aryan descent over the dark-skinned natives (see [dn3:1.10.3]()). ",
  "mn93:6.5": "Both “Greece” (_yona_) and “Persia” (_kamboja_) are loose exonyms to represent the regions dominated by Greek and Iranian culture. | This is the only reference to Greece in an early Buddhist text. Substantial contact between the Greek and Indian worlds only began a century or so after the Buddha with the invasion of Alexander, but this passage suggests that there was at least some contact or knowledge prior to that. | “Persia” is mentioned as one of the sixteen great nations ([an3.70:28.2]()). It was the home of horses, lying to the west of Gandhāra (Pakistan) in modern Afghanistan. This was the easternmost extent of Iranian culture, and the passage here shows how different it was considered compared to the other nations. At this date, I think _kamboja_ meant not just the specific location in Afghanistan, but more generally the Iranian peoples west of Gandhāra, just as _yona_ (“Ionian”) is used for all people from the Greek culture. | The perceived difference in slave culture mirrors the Greek ambassador Megasthenes who, writing over a century later, said there were no slaves in India. ",
  "mn93:11.6": "This seems to be the only mention of the _padumaka_ tree in Pali. It may be the Sanskrit _padmaka_, for which one possible identification is *Prunus cerasoides*, the wild Himalayan cherry. ",
  "mn93:15.1": "This is the only occurrence of sodariya in the prose canon. i think it has a stronger sense than “same mother”, else why include it here? The point, I think, is that they were twins, and hence equal in every way, only differentiated by education. Otherwise surely the elder brother would have been senior. ",
  "mn93:17.3": "BB follows some MSS in omitting tape, but it seems to be required by the sense. It is unusual for the Buddha to refer to sila as tapas, but there you go. ",
  "mn93:18.61": "The _gandhabba_ (normally “centaur”, here “virile spirit”) is, per the commentary, the being to be reborn. He represents the element of male sexuality in procreation. He is “father, begetter, kinsman”, by whose knowledge one becomes the “father’s father” (Arthavaveda 2.1.2–3). He is said to guard (Rig Veda 9.83.4) or steal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.2.4) or actually be (Rig Veda 9.86.36) the vitalizing liquid Soma, who is extracted on an altar as semen is extracted in the vagina (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.3). He thus lies within the waters (Rig Veda 9.86.36, 10.10.4) or within the womb (Rig Veda 10.177.2). It seems that, since semen is “a man’s essence” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.1), the seed of past lovers—curses against whom are helpfully provided (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.9–12)—remains in the womb. This is why the _gandhabba_ possesses women (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.7.1, 3.3.1) and, unless placated with proper worship, might become a “hairy one” who devours embryos (Artharva Veda 8.6.23, see 8.6.18–19). To ward against such risks, in the rites of marriage and procreation, the _gandharva_ king Viśvāvasa, a playboy and deadbeat father, is asked to “rise up” out of the woman (Rig Veda 10.85.21–22, Atharva Veda 14.2.33–6, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.19) and find his pleasures with another, so that the husband may father the child. This contrasts with the Pali passage, where the _gandhabba_ “is ready” for conception; in other words, a being is driven by their karma to be born there. ",
  "mn93:18.63": "Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.10.3–7 details the “path of the fathers” after death; they follow a winding path to the moon Soma, only to return as rain, grow as plants, be eaten, and ultimately be emitted as semen, thus determining the caste of the child. It seems from this passage, however, that this doctrine, convincing as it may seem, was not sufficient to allay male anxiety over paternity. Indeed, the very baroqueness of these conceptions show the doctrinal and ritual lengths required to fix paternity. ",
  "mn93:18.71": "The final phrase here is probably corrupt, and possibly evokes an unknown idiom. The commentarial explanation is implausible. I translate here according to what I think it means. "
