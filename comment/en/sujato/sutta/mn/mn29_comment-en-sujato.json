  "mn29:1.2": "Devadatta was the Buddha’s cousin and nemesis. After going forth together with several other relatives of the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd17:1.4.1]()), his initial success in meditation was corrupted by his desire for gains and fame ([sn17.35]()). He tried to take over the Saṅgha but was denounced by the Buddha. His attempt to create a schismatic faction failed and he died in disgrace. ",
  "mn29:2.8": "The Chinese parallel at EA 43.4 says that this discourse was given during the time he was being lavishly supported by Prince Ajātasattu ([sn17.36](), [pli-tv-kd17:2.1.1]()). ",
  "mn29:2.9": "Compare the “noble quest” on [mn26]() and the search for a “bull elephant” in [mn27](). In each case the metaphor emphasizes the specific and uncompromising nature of the goal. ",
  "mn29:5.14": "While “knowledge and vision” (_ñāṇadassana_) that is “in accordance with reality” (_yathābhūta_) refers to the vision of the four noble truths at stream-entry, “knowledge and vision” by itself does not have a well established technical meaning. At [dn2:83.1]() it is said to be a vision of the body with its consciousness, although this passage is rare and in [mn77:29.11]() is not described as “knowledge and vision”. Elsewhere it is used in a variety of senses for a kind of clear and enhanced spiritual understanding. ",
  "mn29:6.16": "The “irreversible liberation” (asamaya_, literally “not temporary”) is that of arahantship, said to be “irreversible and unshakeable” ([mn122:4.1]()), as opposed to the “temporary liberation” of samādhi, from which one can fall away due to bad conduct ([an5.149]()), like Devadatta.
