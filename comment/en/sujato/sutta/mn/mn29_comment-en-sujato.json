  "mn29:1.2": "Devadatta was the Buddha’s cousin and nemesis. After going forth together with several other family members of the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd17:1.4.1]()), his initial success in meditation was corrupted by his desire for gains and fame ([sn17.35](). He tried to take over the Saṅgha but was denounced by the Buddha. His attempt to cretae a schismatic faction failed and he died in disgrace. This sutta evidently stems from the time after he split the Saṅgha. ",
  "mn29:2.8": "The instrumental should really be “because of”, see BB’s translation of the similar idiom at AN 8.61. But as the text makes clear, the cause is not really the labha, etc., but the ayoniso manasikara that follows it. This becomes more evident in the following sections dealing with sila, etc. This, i think, justifies the oblique rendering here. "
