  "mn41:1.2": "This village is possibly connected to the Śālagrāma famed in later years as the origin of the ammonite stones worshiped as aniconic forms of Vishnu. These stones are found on the Gaṇḍakī river. Against this theory is that this source is too far to the north-east, although in truth we do not know the exact extent of Kosala. The Pali form suggests the name means “hall”, but Sanskrit sources trace Śālagrāma to the sal trees that grow abundantly in the Himalayan foothills. The two Chinese parallels are set in a different location. ",
  "mn41:4.1": "Multiple theories of rebirth are found in Brahmanical texts. For example, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.5 says that rebirth depends on good or bad deeds, but notes the different opinion that only desire matters. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.10.1–5 describes two paths: forest ascetics go the the Brahmā realm, while ritualists go to the moon, from whence those who did good deeds are reborn as human in a good caste, but those who did bad deeds are reborn as outcastes, pigs, or dogs. Those who follow neither path are reborn as small animals or insects. ",
