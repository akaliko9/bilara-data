  "sn35.103:1.2": "This should be marked up as verse. | The idiom of this verse is very unlike the suttas and there seems no reason to doubt it is a genuine quote. However I have not been able to trace it. | In early Sanskrit, _jātu_ has the sense “ever” (Rig Veda 10.27.11a, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.2.2.20, 14.6.8.1). ",
  "sn35.103:1.6": "The story of the Bodhisatta’s studentship uner Uddaka ([mn26:16.9](), etc.) strongly implies that he had not attained the highest meditation that he taught. Nonetheless, the Buddha still had respect for him, which suggests that in making these claims he was not knowingly lying. Rather, he most likely believed that he had attained, but his understanding was insufficient. "
