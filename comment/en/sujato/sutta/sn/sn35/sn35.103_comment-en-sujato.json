  "sn35.103:1.2": "The idiom of this verse is very unlike the suttas. There seems no reason to doubt it is a genuine quote, but I have not been able to trace it. Compare _idañhi jātu me diṭṭhaṁ_ spoken by Brahmā Sahampati at [sn6.13:5.1](). | In early Sanskrit as well as Pali, _jātu_ has the sense “ever” (Rig Veda 10.27.11a, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.2.2.20, 14.6.8.1). ",
  "sn35.103:1.6": "The story of the Bodhisatta’s studentship under Uddaka ([mn26:16.9](), etc.) implies that he had not attained the highest meditation that he taught. Nonetheless, the Buddha still had respect for him, which suggests that in making these claims he was not knowingly lying. Rather, he most likely believed that he had attained, but his understanding was insufficient. | The Buddha assumes that the impersonal pronoun (_idaṁ_) refers to Uddaka himself (_asmi_). The Upaniṣadic doctrine of the identity of the self with the cosmic divinity is often expressed in similar terms: “you are that” (_tat tvam asi_, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7), “that self is divinity” (_ayam ātmā brahma_, Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1.2), “I am that” (_so’ham asmi_, Īśa Upaniṣad 16).
