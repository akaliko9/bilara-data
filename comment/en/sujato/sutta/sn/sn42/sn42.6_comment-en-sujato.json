  "sn42.6:2.1": "The “western brahmins” (_brāhmaṇā pacchā bhūmakā_) hail from lands such as Kuru and Pañcālā or further west to Gandhārā. They are depicted in the suttas as adherents of ritualism, in contrast with the brahmins of the lands of the Buddha, especially Kosala, who were more influenced by the contemplative and philosophical teachings of the Upaniṣads. This tension is felt in the Upaniṣads themselves, as Yājñavalkya for example is accused of flouting the teachings of the Vedic scholars of Kuru and Pañcālā (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.19). ",
  "sn42.6:2.2": "See BB for note on this unique passage. Here sannapeti is causitive from san+yapeti, not san+janati. BB seems to be reading “nama” here as indicanting a report, “said”. I’m not sure that this is correct, and it seems to me more likely it’s the common emphatic sense of nama. In the former case, the speaker is distancing himself from this view, in the latter, supporting it. ",
  "sn42.6:2.3": "I think MS punctuation here is correct; despite the absence of explicit question markers, this is a question. ",
  "sn42.6:4.3": "I follow BB’s interpretation of anuparisakkeyya here, although I am not really sure about it. Readings vary with anuparivatteyya ",
  "sn42.6:7.1": "At Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.6.2–3, Uddālaka compares the ghee that arises as curd is churned to the mind. "
